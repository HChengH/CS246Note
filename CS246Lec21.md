## Recall: RAII

- every resource should be wrapped in a stack-allocated object(where door frees it)

  ```c++
  {
    ifstream file{"test.txt"};
    // stream closed, out-of-scope
  }
  ```

  - this can also be done with dynamic memory

  ```c++
  std::unique_ptr<T>;	//smart pointer to object of type T
  std::make_unique<T>;//allocate space, return unique_ptr
  void f(){
    auto p = std;:make_unique<myClass>();
    myClass mc;
    g();
  }// p is deleted
  ```

- Copying?

  ```c++
  auto p = std::make_unique<c>();
  unique_ptr<c> q = p;	//error
  ```

  - So — copying not allowed
  - moving OK!

------

```c++
template<typename T> class unique_ptr{
  T *ptr;
 public:
  unique_ptr(T *t): ptr{t}{}
  ~unique_ptr(){delete ptr;}
  
  // no copying
  unique_ptr(const unique_ptr<T> &other) = delete;	//compiler won't generate
  unique_ptr<T> &operator=(const unique_ptr<T> &other) = delete;
  
  // move is ok
  unique_ptr(unique_ptr<T> &&other): ptr{other.ptr}{other.ptr = nullptr;}
  unique_ptr<T> &operator=(unique_ptr<T> &&other){
    using std::swap;
    swap(ptr, other.ptr);
    return *this;
  }
  
  // dereference
  T &operator*(){return *ptr;}
}
```

------

- if you want to copy smart-pointers, use a shared ptr

  - `std::shared_ptr`

- e.g.

  ```c++
  void f(){
    auto p1 = std::make_shared<myClass>(); 
    //allocates space for a myClass object
    if(...){
      auto p2 = p1;	//p2 is a copy of p1
    }	//p2 out of scope, but memory stays intact
  }	//p1 goes out of scope, memory is freed
  ```

- shared_ptr — maintains a reference count

  - a cout of all shared pointers pointing at this object
  - memory is freed when reference-count == 0 (i.e. no more shared ptrs)

- So use unique_ptr and shared_ptr as much as possible — eliminates many memory leaks

- For other resources, create classes to manage them (on the stack)

  - e.g. fstream for fifles / Xwindow for windows



## Exception Safety

- There are 3 levels of exceptions safety that f() could provide:

  1. Basic guarantee — if an exceptions occurs, the program will be left in a valid but unspecified state; nothing is leaked; invariants are maintained.
  2. Strong guarantee — if an exceptions is raised while executing f, the state of the program will be as-if f was never called.
  3. No-Throw guarantee — f will never throw an exceptions, and it will always accomplish its task

- e.g.

  ```c++
  class A{};
  class B{};

  class C{
    A a;
    B b;
  public:
    void f(){
      a.method1();	//may throw (strong)
      b.method2();	//may throw (strong)
    }
  };
  ```

  - Is `C::f` exception safe?
    - i.e. what huarantee does it offer - if any?
  - Case 1: `a.method1()` throws
    - nothing has been done yet — OK
    - equiv. to string guarantee for f()
  - Case 2: `b.method2()` throws
    - implies that `a.method()` ran to completion
    - means that f() has to undo the effects of `a.method1()` vefore returing (for the strong guarantee)
    - very hard to do — esp. if a has non-local effects

- So, f is not excpetion safe — as presented

  - if `A::method1` and `B::method2` do not have non-local side effects, we <u>can</u> provide exception safety — with copy - swap idiom

  ```c++
  class C{
    A a;
    B b;
  public:
    void f(){
      A atemp = a;
      B btemp = b;
      
      atemp.method1();	// strong
      btemp.method2();	// strong
      
      a = atemp;	// swap back ? Could throw an ex'n
      b = btemp;
    }
  };
  ```

  - Because copy-assigin can throw, we don't have exceptions safety yet
  - The risk is in the swap part of copy-swap
    - it would be better if we could guarantee that swap was no-throw
    - <u>A non-throwing swap mechanism is the key to exception safety</u>

- Key observation — copying pointers will never fail

- Solution — use pimpl idiom

  ```c++
  struct Cimpl{
    A a;
    B b;
  };

  class C{
    unique_ptr<Cimpl> pimpl = make_unique<Cimpl>():
  public:
    void f(){
      auto temp = make_unique<Cimpl>(*pumpl);
      
      temp->a.method1();	// strong
      temp->b.method2();	// strong
      
      std::swap(pimpl, temp);	// no throw
    }
  };
  ```

  - so f now offers a strong guarantee (i.e. exceptions safe)
    - all operations offer at least a strong guarantee

- On the other hand…. if either `A::method1` and `B::method2` does not offer an exception safety guarantee — then f doesn't either



## Exception Safety & STL vectors

- Vectors

  - encapsilate a heap-allocated array
  - follow RAII — when a stack-allocated vector goes out of scope, the internal heap - allocated array is freed

  ```c++
  void f(){
    vector<myClass>v;
    //...
  }	
  // v goes out-of-scope: myClass dtor is run on all objects that v contains;
  //   then the array is freed

  // but
  void g(){
    vector<myClass *>v;
    //...
  }
  // v goes out of scope, vector doesn't know how to mange pointers
  //    (i.e. who owns the data?); only array is freed - leaks memory
  ```

- In this case, any objects pointed to by pointers in v are not freed

- you have to do it:

  ```c++
  void g(){
    vector<myClass *>v;
    //...
    for(auto &x : v) delete x;	//old-school
  }

  //or

  void g(){
    vector<shared_ptr<myClass>>v;	//smart-pointers
    //...
  }
  ```

  - v goes out of scope; shared_ptr dtor run, frees objects if no other shared_ptrs; then array is freed
    - i.e. we don't have to do any explicit deallocation!

------

- e.g. `vector<T>::emplace_back`

  - offers the string guarantee (i.e. never corrupt)

  - if array is full (cap == size)

    1. allocate a new, larger array

    2. copy objects over from old->new (copy ctor)

       - if copy ctor throws


       - destroy new array(dont touch old array)

    3. delete old array

  - this offers the strong guarantee, but copying is slow and we're just throwing away the old data.

  - ideally. we can just steal the old data(move ctor/ assign)

  - but then we have to worry about exceptons safety for move
