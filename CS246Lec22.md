## Recall: Exception safety & vector

- `vector<T>::emplace_back` — offers strong guarantee

  - if array is full
    - create a new/bigger array
    - copy objects over (copy ctor)
      - if copy ctor throws
        - destroy new array
        - return old/intact array
    - destroy old
    - return new

- But copying is expensive!

  - instead of deleting old data, move/steal it
    - i.e. alocate new array
    - move old data(move ctor)
    - delete old
  - if move ctor throws, then we may have corrupt data — i.e. partial move
    - no strong guarantee!
  - if the move ctor is no-throw (i.e. we ensure that move will never throw an exception)
    - emplace back will use move
  - but if move cannot guarantee no-throw
    - emplace_back will use copy(to ensure strong guarantee)
  - we can implement move using ptrs/pimpl, we can guarantee no-throw

- So, we can tell the compiler that our move operations are no throw:

  ```c++
  class myClass{
  public:
    myClass(myClass &&other)noexcept{}
    myClass &operator=(myClass &&other)noexcept{}
  };
  ```

- if you know that a function will never throw or propogate an exception, declare it noexcept

  - facilitates optimization
  - at a minimum, your move & swap operations should be noexcept



## Casting

- force an object to be treated as an object of a different type

  - in C:

    ```c++
    Node n;
    int *ip = (int *)&n;	//"blind cast"
    ```

  - C-style casts should be avoided in C++

    - subvert type system — vary BAD
    - if you must cast, use C++ style casting

  - "Casts are so … bad, C++ gives you 4 different ways to do them"

    - allows you to isolate by keyword
    - allows you to specify intent of the cast (to compiler, other devs)
    - deliberate — compiler will not do for you — you need to initiate

  1. static_cast — "intuitive", "reasoonable"

     - e.g. double->int

       ```c++
       void f(double x);	//1
       void f(int x);		//2
       double d = 3.0;
       f(d);	// 1 since calling function that accepts double
       f(static_cast<int>d)	// 2-version of function with int
       ```

     - e.g. superclass ptr -> subclass ptr

       ```c++
       Book *b = new Text{...};
       // ...
       Text *t = static_cast<Text *>(b);
       t->getTopic();
       ```

     - This works because b was porting at a Text

       - i.e. I knew it was "reasonable"

     - you take responsibility — compiler doesn't check for you

     - telling the compiler "trust me"

  ------

  2. reinterpret_cast — "strange" conversions

     - e.g.

       ```c++
       student s;
       Turtle *t = reinterpret_cast<Turtle *>(&s);	//OK...
       ```

     - Like telling the compiler "I trust you to blindly do this..."

     - Not something you will do often/even

- see git lectures/c++/casting

  - e.g. modifying a private variable

    ```c++
    class C{
      int x; 	//private
    public:
      explicit C(int xval):x{xval}{}
      int getx(){return x;}
    };
    ```

    ```c++
    class RogueC{
    public:
      int x;
    };

    int main(){
      C c(10);
      cout << c.getx()<<endl;	//10
      RogueC *r = reinterpret_cast<RogueC *>(&c);
      r->x = 20;
      cout << c.getx() << endl;	//20
    }
    ```

- It's all <u>just memory</u>

  - e.g. 2D arrays
    - allocating space on the heap
      - continuous memory
      - one large block
    - pointer arithmetic — walk through
    - better use of reinterpret_cast ? — reinterpret block of memory as a 2D array

  ------

  3. const_cast — converging const/non-const

     - This is the only way to "cast away" const(i.e. get rid of const)

     - e.g.

       ```c++
       void g(int *p); // g makes no promises to not change p
       void f(const int *p) //f promises that p will not be changed
       {
         //...
         g(p);		//error-broken promise
       }
       ```


  - - This won't compile, since g doesn't know to not-change p, but what if you know better? fI know g won't change p ("truse me")ex

      ```c++
      void g(int *g);
      void f(const int *p){
        g(const_cast<int *>p);	// passed as non-const
      }
      ```

  ------

  4. dynamic_cast — sim to a static cast, "reasonable" things

     - Q - "is it safe to cast x to y"

     - e.g. is it safe to convert a Book * to a Text *?

       ```c++
       Book *pb = getABook();
       static_cast<Text *>(pb)->getTopic();	//not the best way to do this
       // is this ok?
       //   if it's a Text, it's fine
       //   if it's not a Text, ...bad
       ```

     - Better to do something tentative i.e. check the type

       ```c++
       Book *bp = getABook();
       Text *tp = dynamic_cast<Text *>(bp);
       ```

       - if the cast works(i.e. it's actually a Text) — tp will be valid ptr to a Text object
       - if the cast fails (i.e. it's not a Text) — tp will equal NULLPTR
       - always returns — check tp to figure out result

       ```c++
       if(tp){
         cout << "Text";
       }
       else{
         cout << "Not a Text";
       }
       ```

     - why would you ever use a static cast?

       - static_cast — "free"
       - dynamic_cast — "costly"

  ------

- These are operations on raw pointers

  - we have versions for smart pointers too!
    - static_pointer_cast
    - const_pointer_cast
    - dynamic_pointer_cast
    - NO reinterpret_pointer_cast

- you can use dynamic casts to delermine object type at runtime(eTTI — runtime type information)

  - e.g.

    ```c++
    void whatIsIt(shared_ptr<Book>b){
      if(dynamic_pointer_cast<Text> b) cout << "Text";
      else if(dynamic_pointer_cast<Comic> b) cout << "Comic";
      else cout << "Book";
    }
    ```

  - Dynamic casting only works with classes that have at least 1 virtual method

    - why? Next week….

  - Code like this is vary tightly coupled to Book hierarchy

    - suggests bad design — use virtual methods(or visitor pattern)
    - hard to modify after-the-fact
      - e.g. I want to add a new type of book(e.g. Cookbook)
      - Cookbook class
      - look for dynamic_casts text check type, and make sure cookbook is represented
