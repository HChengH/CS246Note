## Recall: Destructors(dtor)

- the destructor runs when an object is destroyed

  - stack allocated — out of scope
  - heap allocated — deleted

- sequence

  - dtor body runs
  - fields that are object — detors run
  - space deallocated

- default dtor — runs dtors for fields(that are object)

- when to write a dtor?

  - dynamic memory

  ```c++
  struct Node{
    int data;
    Node *next;
  };

  Node *np = new Node{1,new Node{2, new Node{3, nullptr}}};

  int foo(){
    Node *np = new Node{1,new Node{2, new Node{3, nullptr}}};
    ...;
    ...;
    return 0; // return -stack allocated varables are destroyed
    			// i.e. np is destroyed, nodes leak
  }

  int bar(){
    Node *np = new Node{1,new Node{2, new Node{3, nullptr}}};
    ...;
    delete np;	//delete np, next(first Node is destroyed, 
    				//   Node 1-2 dangling/ leak)
    				//pointer no is auto destroyed
  }
  ```

  ```c++
  struct Node{
    int data;
    Node *next;
    ~Node(){
      delete next;
    }
  };
  ```

## Copy assignment operator

```c++
Student billy {90, 92, 97};	//ctor
Student jane = billy;		//copy ctor -initialization 
							//  from another object
Student joey;				//default ctor
joey = billy;				//copy assignment operator
```

- classes have a default copy assignment operator

  - just does a copy-assign of fields (shallow copy)
  - you will want to define your own for dynamic memory

  e.g.

  ```c++
  struct Node{
    int data;
    Node *next;
    ~Node(){
      delete next;
    }
    Node &operator=(const Node &other){
      data = other.data;
      delete next;
      next = other.next? new Node{*other.next} : nullptr;
      return *this;
    }
  };

  int main(){
    Node n{1, new Node{2, nullptr}};	//stack, 2 nodes
    //....
    n = n;
    p = q;	//points to same thing
    //....
    return 0;
  }
  ```

  - `n = n`  — deletes n, and then tries to copy n to n
    - undefined
    - very bad
    - problem of self— assignment
  - assign operatos(=) should always check for self- assignment

  ```c++
  struct Node{
    int data;
    Node *next;
    Node &operator=(const Node &other){
      if(this == &other){
        return *this;
      }
      data = other.data;
      delete next;
      next = other.next? new Node{*other.next} : nullptr;
      return *this;
    }
  };
  ```

  - 2 other issues:
    - what if other is a node in the same list ?
      - end up  deleting the list before you copy from it
    - what if new fails?
      - we deleted next but no data to assign
      - inconsistent state

  ```c++
  struct Node{
    int data;
    Node *next;
    Node &operator=(const Node &other){
      if(this == &other){
        return *this;
      }
      Node *tmp = next;
      next = other.next? new Node{*other.next} : nullptr;
      // if new fails, function will return immedialely from here
      data = other.data;
      delete tmp;
      return *this;
    }
  };
  ```

  ```c++
  #include <utility>
  struct Node{
    int data;
    Node *next;
    void swap(Node &other){
      using std::swap;
      swap(data, other.data);
      swap(next, other.next);
    }
    
    Node &operator=(const Node &other){
      Node temp = other;	//copy ctor, on stack
      swap(tmp);			//swap this w. temp
      return *this;		//tmp is auto-deallocated, 
      					//   destroying original data
    }
  };
  ```

## R-values & R-value references

- `int x = 5;`

  ``l-value = r-calue`

  - l-value has to have an address
  - r-value is anything that not an l-value

- l-value references (&)

  - const pointers
    - auto dereference
    - always initialized

- Consider:

  ```c++
  Node{1, new Node{2, nullptr}};	//stack, 2 nodes
  Node m = n;	//copy ctor
  Node m2;
  m2 = n;	//copy assign

  Node plusOne(Node n){
    for(Node *p = &n; p; p->next){
      ++p->data;
    }
    return n;				//2.copy ctor
  }

  Node m3 = plusOne(n);	//1.copy ctor - pass by value
  						//3.copy ctor - init m3
  ```

  - compiler creates a temp copy of n to pass to the function, which is discarded when it returns

    - i.e. creating a temp copy, maniplating data and discarding it.
    - — wasteful — just prefer to create one temp and steal data in the function

  - assumption: we have to know that its a temp before we can steal data in C++, theres a way to tell:

    - an r-value reference is a reference to a temporary r-value

    - r-value reference uses &&

      l-value reference uses &

    - Node &&       temp object of r-value Node

      Node &          temp l-value Node

  - write a version of a copy constructor that takes r-value

    ```c++
    struct Node{
      int data;
      Node *next;
      Node(Node &&other): data{other.data}, next{other.next}
      {
        other.next = nullptr;	
        //make sure compiler doesn't deallocate
        //   Nodes when other goes out of scope
      }
    };

    // moue constructor
    ```

    similarly:

    ```c++
    Node n;
    m = plusOne(n);	//1.copy ctor - by value
    				//2.copy ctor - returns
    				//3.copy assignment
    ```

    - once again, we want to **steal** from the temp

    move assignment operator:

    ```c++
    struct Node{
      int data;
      Node *next;
      Node &operator=(Node &&other){
        using std::swap;
        swap(data, other.data);	//swaps between
        swap(next, other.next);	//other holds old data
        return *this;			//old is deleted
      }
    }
    ```

    - if you **don't** define move ctor/move asign, copying versions will be used instead
    - if the move ctor/ move assign is defined, it will **replace** all calls to copy ctor/ copy assign, where arg is an r-value(temp)

## Copy/Move Elision

```c++
struct Vec{
  int x,y;
}

Vec makeAVec(){
  return {1,2};		//1.ctor
  					//2.copy ctor - return by value
}

Vec v = makeAVec();
```

- in g++, it only calls the constructor **Not** the copy constructor

  - temp is returned directly on stack

- in some circumstances, the compiler is allowed to skip copy/move ctors

  e.g:

  ```c++
  void doSomething(Vec v){	//pass by value
    //...
  }
  doSomething(makeAVec());	//normally call move ctor
  ```

  - returning Vec can be used directly asa parameter
    - saving the move call

- copy elision is allowed, even if dropping constructors would change behaviour

  - you are not expected to know details!
  - turn off:
    - `g++ -fno-elide-constructors ....`
    - will hurt performance
